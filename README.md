# PetCuddleOTron
This is a serverless reminder application. The application will load from an s3 bucket and run in browser. It communicates with Lambda and STep FUnctions via Api Gateway endpiont. This project is from Adrian Cantrills AWS course but with my own cdk implementation instead of doing it via console.
